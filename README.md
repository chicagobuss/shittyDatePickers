## What Makes It Shitty?

The current version features **interdependent spinning digits** - like an old mechanical odometer where all the digits physically drag each other around!

- Adjusting the year? Watch your month digits spin out of control!
- Each digit influences its neighbors, making precise date selection hilariously frustrating

## Inspiration
