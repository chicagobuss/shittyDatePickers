# Shitty Date Picker

A deliberately terrible date picker with physics-based interactions!

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in your browser to start experimenting.

## Current Features

- Ball-on-string physics simulation (like the cup-and-ball game)
- Mouse/touch interaction to swing the ball
- Adjustable string length and gravity
- Canvas-based rendering

## How to Use

1. Move your mouse over the canvas to position it
2. Click and drag the ball to swing it around
3. Adjust the controls to experiment with different physics parameters

## Next Steps for Your Date Picker

Some ideas for incorporating this into a terrible date picker:

- Make users "catch" date numbers in a cup
- Have calendar days swing on strings and users must click them at the right moment
- Create a pendulum of months/years that users must stop at the right time
- Make the entire date selection require skillful timing and hand-eye coordination

Have fun making the worst UX possible! ðŸŽ¯
